## About

Welcome! This analysis explores the statistics of the 2018 Major League Baseball (MLB) season, examining both individual player and team performance. The goal of this project is to ascertain whether there was any correlation between the top players and the most successful teams.

Unlike other team sports, a high payroll, indicative of having the best players, does not always guarantee success. In basketball, securing the number one draft pick in the National Basketball Association  (NBA) can transform a franchise dramatically, whereas in baseball, a top draft pick may not necessarily secure a spot on a major league team.
