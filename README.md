## About

Welcome! This analysis explores the statistics of the 2018 Major League Baseball (MLB) season, examining both individual player and team performance. The goal of this project is to ascertain whether there was any correlation between the top players and the most successful teams.

Unlike other team sports, a high payroll, indicative of having the best players, does not always guarantee success. In basketball, securing the number one draft pick in the National Basketball Association  (NBA) can transform a franchise dramatically, whereas in baseball, a top draft pick may not necessarily secure a spot on a major league team.

## Installation

Before you start to explore the project, please ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python. This project was developed using Python 3.11.1. If you don't have Python installed or if you need to upgrade your current version, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- You have installed Git, which is necessary to clone the repository. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   Navigate to the directory where you want the cloned repository to be placed by using the ``cd`` command in your terminal followed by the path of the directory.

   Then you can clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   git clone https://github.com/JMNAJE/data_analysis_capstone.git
2. **Navigate to the cloned directory**

   Change your current directory to the cloned repository's directory data_analysis_capstone.
3. **Set up a virtual environment**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the project's dependencies isolated from your system's Python environment. You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

   On Windows:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a new virtual environment named `venv` in your current directory.
4. **Activate the virtual environment**

   Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

   On Windows:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now operating within a Python virtual environment.
5. **Install the required packages**

   Install the required packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   You're now ready to run the project!
6. **Run the ``data_analysis_capstone.ipynb`` file:**

   - If you have Jupyter Notebook installed, enter ``jupyter notebook`` and open the `.ipynb` file.
   - If you are using Visual Studio Code, open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells using the run button that appears at the top left of each cell.

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply type `deactivate` in your terminal.

## Data Analysis Capstone Requirements | Spring 2023

**Category 1: Loading Data:**

- Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.).

**Category 2: Clean and Operate the Data While Combining Them:**

- Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.

**Category 3: Visualize/Present Your Data:**

- Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
- *Make a Tableau dashboard to display your data.*

**Category 4: Best Practices:**

- Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.

**Category 5: Interpretation of Your Data:**

- Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don't have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
